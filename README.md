JavaPrototype
=============

This a prototype of a project I am working on at University.

In it's current state the GUI provides full CRUD access to the datamodel, all data is lost on closing aside from the single entry that's hardcoded.

This is for the HCI part of the project so the emphises has gone onto the internface rather than the back end as the
final product will conenct to a database and pull and push data from it.
